                    As was mentioned in my about page, I am a <b>dancer</b>. I started at the age of three and have been dancing ever since. 
                    I absolutely adore dancing – it is a huge part of my life. 
                    If I wasn’t at school, I was dancing. If I wasn’t sleeping, I was dancing. 
                    If I had any free time, it was spent at the studio. Quite honestly, I don’t think I’d be the person I am today without dance. 
                    It has not only helped my physical well being, but it has made me into a better person as well. 
                    I have made so many lifelong friends, gained so many experiences, and truly gained so many different life skills that will aid me in my everyday life. 
                    I wouldn’t be who I am without dance.

                    Other than dance, there are a few other small hobbies I enjoy. 
                    One of the main ones is <b>photography</b>. 
                    I love taking photos of anything and everything I see. 
                    I love being able to look back at all my old photos and relive those memories. 
                    Such as the photo to the side – I took it when I went camping with my family and my dad and I went to go look at the stars. 
                    It was pure chance that the Northen Lights happened to be out. They were so faint in person, but on camera they showed up well!
